abstract={Solar magnetograms are important for studying solar activity and predicting space weather disturbances1. Farside magnetograms can be constructed from local helioseismology without any farside data2-4, but their quality is lower than that of typical frontside magnetograms. Here we generate farside solar magnetograms from STEREO/Extreme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) 304-{\AA} images using a deep learning model based on conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs). We train the model using pairs of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 304-{\AA} images and SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetograms taken from 2011 to 2017 except for September and October each year. We evaluate the model by comparing pairs of SDO/HMI magnetograms and cGAN-generated magnetograms in September and October. Our method successfully generates frontside solar magnetograms from SDO/AIA 304-{\AA} images and these are similar to those of the SDO/HMI, with Hale-patterned active regions being well replicated. Thus we can monitor the temporal evolution of magnetic fields from the farside to the frontside of the Sun using SDO/HMI and farside magnetograms generated by our model when farside extreme-ultraviolet data are available. This study presents an application of image-to-image translation based on cGANs to scientific data.},
