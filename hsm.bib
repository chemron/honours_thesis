	abstract = {Solar gravity modes (or g modes)—oscillations of the solar interior on which buoyancy acts as the restoring force—have the potential to provide unprecedented inference on the structure and dynamics of the solar core, inference that is not possible with the well-observed acoustic modes (or p modes). The relative high amplitude of the g-mode eigenfunctions in the core and the evanesence of the modes in the convection zone make the modes particularly sensitive to the physical and dynamical conditions in the core. Owing to the existence of the convection zone, the g modes have very low amplitudes at photospheric levels, which makes the modes extremely hard to detect. In this article, we review the current state of play regarding attempts to detect g modes. We review the theory of g modes, including theoretical estimation of the g-mode frequencies, amplitudes and damping rates. Then we go on to discuss the techniques that have been used to try to detect g modes. We review results in the literature, and finish by looking to the future, and the potential advances that can be made—from both data and data-analysis perspectives—to give unambiguous detections of individual g modes. The review ends by concluding that, at the time of writing, there is indeed a consensus amongst the authors that there is currently no undisputed detection of solar g modes.},

	abstract = {Helioseismology is the study of the solar interior using observations of waves on the Sun's surface. It has done much to improve our understanding of the interior of the Sun, testing the physical inputs used to model stellar interiors and providing a detailed map of the Sun's structure and internal rotation. This in turn has greatly influenced theories of the solar magnetic dynamo. These interior studies thus make a valuable bridge between solar physics and studies of the structure and evolution of other stars. Recent developments include new local techniques for unprecedented studies of subsurface structures and flows in emerging active regions, under sunspots, and even of active regions on the far side of the Sun. These developments hold the possibility of a real understanding of how the interior links to solar magnetic activity in the corona and heliosphere. Finally, studies such as those of the deep solar interior are on the verge of becoming possible for other stars exhibiting similar multimode oscillations.},

	abstract = {The splitting of the frequencies of the global resonant acoustic modes of the Sun by large-scale flows and rotation permits study of the variation of angular velocity Ω with both radius and latitude within the turbulent convection zone and the deeper radiative interior. The nearly uninterrupted Doppler imaging observations, provided by the Solar Oscillations Investigation (SOI) using the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft positioned at the L1 Lagrangian point in continuous sunlight, yield oscillation power spectra with very high signal-to-noise ratios that allow frequency splittings to be determined with exceptional accuracy. This paper reports on joint helioseismic analyses of solar rotation in the convection zone and in the outer part of the radiative core. Inversions have been obtained for a medium-l mode set (involving modes of angular degree l extending to about 250) obtained from the first 144 day interval of SOI-MDI observations in 1996. Drawing inferences about the solar internal rotation from the splitting data is a subtle process. By applying more than one inversion technique to the data, we get some indication of what are the more robust and less robust features of our inversion solutions. Here we have used seven different inversion methods. To test the reliability and sensitivity of these methods, we have performed a set of controlled experiments utilizing artificial data. This gives us some confidence in the inferences we can draw from the real solar data. The inversions of SOI-MDI data have confirmed that the decrease of Ω with latitude seen at the surface extends with little radial variation through much of the convection zone, at the base of which is an adjustment layer, called the tachocline, leading to nearly uniform rotation deeper in the radiative interior. A prominent rotational shearing layer in which Ω increases just below the surface is discernible at low to mid latitudes. Using the new data, we have also been able to study the solar rotation closer to the poles than has been achieved in previous investigations. The data have revealed that the angular velocity is distinctly lower at high latitudes than the values previously extrapolated from measurements at lower latitudes based on surface Doppler observations and helioseismology. Furthermore, we have found some evidence near latitudes of 75° of a submerged polar jet which is rotating more rapidly than its immediate surroundings. Superposed on the relatively smooth latitudinal variation in Ω are alternating zonal bands of slightly faster and slower rotation, each extending some 10° to 15° in latitude. These relatively weak banded flows have been followed by inversion to a depth of about 5\% of the solar radius and appear to coincide with the evolving pattern of "torsional oscillations" reported from earlier surface Doppler studies.},

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Synoptic maps of the far hemisphere of the Sun calculated from seismic holography have proven to be very reliable in localizing large active regions before they rotate onto the visible hemisphere. We show here the first results toward a calibration of the far-side signatures of active regions in terms of active region size and magnetic field strength. We compare helioseismic maps of large active regions on the far side of the Sun, calculated from Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) Doppler observations, with magnetic and visible-continuum images of the same active regions on the visible hemisphere before and after their far-side passage. The far-side seismic signature is expressed as a phase shift that a far-side active region introduces to waves from the near hemisphere as they are reflected into the solar interior on their way back to the near hemisphere. There is a significant correlation between this far-side signature and both the total area of the active region, as viewed on the near hemisphere, and the area of the sunspots contained in the active region. We have studied the relationship between the magnetic field strength and the phase signature for six of the larger, more stable active regions. We find an approximately logarithmic increase in the seismic phase signature with increasing magnetic field strengths above a critical field of ~10 G. This is roughly consistent with similar helioseismic signatures measured on the near solar hemisphere concurrent with associated magnetic fields.}
