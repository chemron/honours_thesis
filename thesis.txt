Extreme space weather events such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections can be hazardous to our increasingly technological society, with the potential to cause mass blackouts, loss of communication, or failure of satellites. Currently, potentially hazardous active regions can only be identified \(\sim 7\) days before directly facing the Earth due to the rotation of the Sun. He we report the ability to generate synthetic farside magnetograms using only seismic maps - farside images of the Sun created by helioseismic holography. While the magnetograms have mixed results when locating active regions, they predict an unsigned magnetic flux which peaks during times of intense solar activity.
