abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The analysis of waves on the visible side of the Sun allows the detection of active regions on the far side through local helioseismology techniques. Knowing the magnetism in the whole Sun, including the non-visible hemisphere, is fundamental for several space weather forecasting applications.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Seismic identification of far-side active regions is challenged by the reduced signal-to-noise ratio, and only large and strong active regions can be reliable detected. Here we develop a new method to improve the identification of active region signatures in far-side seismic maps.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We constructed a deep neural network that associates the far-side seismic maps obtained from helioseismic holography with the probability that active regions lie on the far side. The network was trained with pairs of helioseismic phase-shift maps and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetograms acquired half a solar rotation later, which were used as a proxy for the presence of active regions on the far side. The method was validated using a set of artificial data, and it was also applied to actual solar observations during the period of minimum activity of solar cycle 24.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Our approach shows a higher sensitivity to the presence of far-side active regions than standard methods that have been applied up to date. The neural network can significantly increase the number of detected far-side active regions, and will potentially improve the application of far-side seismology to space weather forecasting.},

abstract = {We present Morpheus, a new model for generating pixel-level morphological classifications of astronomical sources. Morpheus leverages advances in deep learning to perform source detection, source segmentation, and morphological classification pixel-by-pixel via a semantic segmentation algorithm adopted from the field of computer vision. By utilizing morphological information about the flux of real astronomical sources during object detection, Morpheus shows resiliency to false-positive identifications of sources. We evaluate Morpheus by performing source detection, source segmentation, morphological classification on the Hubble Space Telescope data in the five CANDELS fields with a focus on the GOODS South field, and demonstrate a high completeness in recovering known GOODS South 3D-HST sources with H {\textless} 26 AB. We release the code publicly, provide online demonstrations, and present an interactive visualization of the Morpheus results in GOODS South.},

abstract = {The topology and dynamics of the solar chromosphere are greatly affected by the presence of magnetic fields. The magnetic field can be inferred by analyzing polarimetric observations of spectral lines. Polarimetric signals induced by chromospheric magnetic fields are, however, particularly weak, and in most cases very close to the detection limit of current instrumentation. Because of this, there are only few observational studies that have successfully reconstructed the three components of the magnetic field vector in the chromosphere. Traditionally, the signal-to-noise ratio of observations has been improved by performing time-averages or spatial averages, but in both cases, some information is lost. More advanced techniques, like principal-component analysis, have also been employed to take advantage of the sparsity of the observations in the spectral direction. In the present study, we use the spatial coherence of the observations to reduce the noise using deep-learning techniques. We designed a neural network that is capable of recovering weak signals under a complex noise corruption (including instrumental artifacts and non-linear post-processing). The training of the network is carried out without a priori knowledge of the clean signals, or an explicit statistical characterization of the noise or other corruption. We only use the same observations as our generative model. The performance of this method is demonstrated on both synthetic experiments and real data. We show examples of the improvement in typical signals obtained in current telescopes such as the Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope. The presented method can recover weak signals equally well no matter what spectral line or spectral sampling is used. It is especially suitable for cases when the wavelength sampling is scarce.},

abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Spatial correlations between spiral arms and other galactic components such as giant molecular clouds and massive OB stars suggest that spiral arms can play vital roles in various aspects of disk galaxy evolution. Segmentation of spiral arms in disk galaxies is therefore a key task when these correlations are to be investigated.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We therefore decomposed disk galaxies into spiral and nonspiral regions using the code U-Net, which is based on deep-learning algorithms and has been invented for segmentation tasks in biology.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We first trained this U-Net with a large number of synthesized images of disk galaxies with known properties of symmetric spiral arms with radially constant pitch angles and then tested it with entirely unknown data sets. The synthesized images were generated from mathematical models of disk galaxies with various properties of spiral arms, bars, and rings in these supervised-learning tasks. We also applied the trained U-Net to spiral galaxy images synthesized from the results of long-term hydrodynamical simulations of disk galaxies with nonsymmetric spiral arms.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We find that U-Net can predict the precise locations of spiral arms with an average prediction accuracy ({\textless}i{\textgreater}F{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}m{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) of 98\%. We also find that {\textless}i{\textgreater}F{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}m{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} does not depend strongly on the numbers of spiral arms, presence or absence of stellar bars and rings, and bulge-to-disk ratios in disk galaxies. These results imply that U-Net is a very useful tool for identifying the locations of spirals arms. However, we find that the U-Net trained on these symmetric spiral arm images cannot predict entirly unknown data sets with the same accuracy that were produced from the results of hydrodynamical simulations of disk galaxies with nonsymmetric irregular spirals and their nonconstant pitch angles across disks. In particular, weak spiral arms in barred-disk galaxies are properly segmented.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} These results suggest that U-Net can segment more symmetric spiral arms with constant pitch angles in disk galaxies. However, we need to train U-Net with a larger number of more realistic galaxy images with noise, nonsymmetric spirals, and different pitch angles between different arms in order to apply it to real spiral galaxies. It would be a challenge to make a large number of training data sets for such realistic nonsymmetric and irregular spiral arms with nonconstant pitch angles.},
