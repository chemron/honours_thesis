	abstract = {It is generally appreciated that the September 1859 solar–terrestrial disturbance, the first recognized space weather event, was exceptionally large. How large and how exceptional? To answer these questions, we compiled rank order lists of the various measures of solar-induced disturbance for events from 1859 to the present. The parameters considered included: magnetic crochet amplitude, solar energetic proton fluence (McCracken et al., 2001a), Sun–Earth disturbance transit time, geomagnetic storm intensity, and low-latitude auroral extent. While the 1859 event has close rivals or superiors in each of the above categories of space weather activity, it is the only documented event of the last ∼150 years that appears at or near the top of all of the lists. Taken together, the top-ranking events in each of the disturbance categories comprise a set of benchmarks for extreme space weather activity.},

The physical properties (thickness, length, temperature, and density) of the CSLS are evaluated. In regions adjacent to the CSLS, the EUV emission (characteristic temperature at 1.6 MK) begins to increase more than 10 minutes prior to the onset of the flare, and steeply decreases during the decay phase. The reduction of the emission resembles that expected from coronal dimming. The dynamics of this event imply a magnetic reconnection rate in the range 0.01–0.05.},

	abstract = {A theoretical model of flare which explains observed quantities in Hα, EUV, soft X-ray and flare-associated solar wind is presented. It is assumed that large mass observed in the soft X-ray flare and the solar wind comes from the chromosphere by the process like evaporation while flare is in progress. From mass and pressure balance in the chromosphere and the corona, the high temperature in the soft X-ray flare is shown to be attained by the larger mass loss to the solar wind compared with the mass remained in the corona, in accord with observations. The total energy of 1032 erg, the electron density of 1013.5 cm−3 in Hα flare, the temperature of the X-ray flare of 107.3K and the time to attain maximum Hα brightness (600 s) are derived consistent with observations. It is shown that the top height of the Hα flare is located about 1000 km lower than that of the active chromosphere because of evaporation. So-called limb flares are assigned to either post-flare loops, surges or rising prominences.},

Typically, the results from Skylab indicate that pre-existing closed magnetic loops in the corona are torn open by the force of the disruption. We examine here some of the theoretical consequences to be expected during the extended relaxation phase which must follow such events. This phase is characterized by a gradual reconnection of the outward-distended field lines. In particular, the enhanced coronal expansion which occurs on open field lines just before they reconnect appears adequate to supply the large downward mass fluxes observed in Ha loop prominence systems that form during the post-transient relaxation. In addition, this enhanced flow may produce nonrecurrent high speed streams in the solar wind after such events. Calculations of the relaxation phase for representative field geometries and the resulting flow configurations are described.},

abstract = {Abstract We investigate satellite orbital drag effects at low-Earth orbit associated with thermosphere heating during magnetic storms caused by coronal mass ejections. CHAllenge Mini-satellite Payload (CHAMP) and Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) neutral density data are used to compute orbital drag. Storm-to-quiet density comparisons are performed with background densities obtained by the Jacchia-Bowman 2008 (JB2008) empirical model. Our storms are grouped in different categories regarding their intensities as indicated by minimum values of the SYM-H index. We then perform superposed epoch analyses with storm main phase onset as zero epoch time. In general, we find that orbital drag effects are larger for CHAMP (lower altitudes) in comparison to GRACE (higher altitudes). Results show that storm time drag effects manifest first at high latitudes, but for extreme storms, particularly observed by GRACE, stronger orbital drag effects occur during early main phase at low/equatorial latitudes, probably due to heating propagation from high latitudes. We find that storm time orbital decay along the satellites' path generally increases with storm intensity, being stronger and faster for the most extreme events. For these events, orbital drag effects decrease faster probably due to elevated cooling effects caused by nitric oxide, which introduce modeled density uncertainties during storm recovery phase. Errors associated with total orbit decay introduced by JB2008 are generally the largest for the strongest storms and increase during storm times, particular during recovery phases. We discuss the implication of these uncertainties for the prediction of collision between space objects at low-Earth orbit during magnetic storms.},

When CMEs were first discovered in the 1970s it was suggested that they were powered by solar flares (e.g., Dryer, 1982). Research since then (Harrison, 1986) has indicated that there is an associated flare that occurs shortly after the CME. To investigate this further, and making no assumption that a particular flare is causally connected to the CME, flaring activity in nine active regions that show one or more CME signatures has been studied for several hours before and after CME launch. Although the initiation of the CME may occur on size scales larger than the active region itself, definite changes are seen in the flaring activity which may be related to the ejection. This work indicates that the energy released from the active region magnetic field via flaring is greater prior to the CME launch than after.},

	abstract = {Most coronal mass ejections (CMEs) start as coronal storms which are caused by an opening of channels of closed field lines along the zero line of the longitudinal magnetic field. This can happen along any zero line on the Sun where the configuration is destabilized. If the opening includes a zero line inside an active region, one observes a chromospheric flare. If this does not happen, no flare is associated with the CME in the chromosphere, but the process, as well as the response in the corona (a Long Decay Event in X-rays) remains the same. The only difference between flare-associated and non-flare-associated CMEs is the strength of the magnetic field in the region of the field line opening. This can explain essentially all differences which have been observed between these two kinds of CMEs. However, there are obviously also other sources of CMEs, different from coronal storms: sprays (giving rise to narrow, pointed ejections), erupting interconnecting loops (often destabilized by flares), and growing coronal holes. This paper tries to summarize and interpret observations which support this general picture, and demonstrates that both CMEs and flares must be properly discussed in any study of solar-terrestrial relations.},

	abstract = {The temporal relationship between coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and associated solar flares is of great importance to understanding the origin of CMEs, but it has been difficult to study owing to the nature of CME detection. In this paper, we investigate this issue using the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph and the EUV Imaging Telescope observations combined with GOES soft X-ray observations. We present four well-observed events whose source regions are close to the limb such that we are able to directly measure the CMEs' initial evolution in the low corona ( 1-3 R☉) without any extrapolation; this height range was not available in previous space-based coronagraph observations. The velocity-time profiles show that kinematic evolution of three of the four CMEs can be described in a three-phase scenario: the initiation phase, impulsive acceleration phase, and propagation phase. The initiation phase is characterized by a slow ascension with a speed less than 80 km s-1 for a period of tens of minutes. The initiation phase always occurs before the onset of the associated flare. Following the initiation phase, the CMEs display an impulsive acceleration phase that coincides very well with the flares' rise phase lasting for a few to tens of minutes. The acceleration of CMEs ceases near the peak time of the soft X-ray flares. The CMEs then undergo a propagation phase, which is characterized by a constant speed or slowly decreasing in speed. The acceleration rates in the impulsive acceleration phase are in the range of 100-500 m s-2. One CME (on 1997 November 6, associated with an X9.4 flare) does not show an initiation phase. It has an extremely large acceleration rate of 7300 m s-2. The possible causes of CME initiation and acceleration in connection with flares are explored.},

A series of apogee-motor firings lifted SDO from an initial geosynchronous transfer orbit into a circular geosynchronous orbit inclined by 28° about the longitude of the SDO-dedicated ground station in New Mexico. SDO began returning science data on 1 May 2010. SDO is the first space-weather mission in NASA’s Living With a Star (LWS) Program. SDO’s main goal is to understand, driving toward a predictive capability, those solar variations that influence life on Earth and humanity’s technological systems. The SDO science investigations will determine how the Sun’s magnetic field is generated and structured, how this stored magnetic energy is released into the heliosphere and geospace as the solar wind, energetic particles, and variations in the solar irradiance. Insights gained from SDO investigations will also lead to an increased understanding of the role that solar variability plays in changes in Earth’s atmospheric chemistry and climate. The SDO mission includes three scientific investigations (the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE), and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)), a spacecraft bus, and a dedicated ground station to handle the telemetry. The Goddard Space Flight Center built and will operate the spacecraft during its planned five-year mission life; this includes: commanding the spacecraft, receiving the science data, and forwarding that data to the science teams. The science investigations teams at Stanford University, Lockheed Martin Solar Astrophysics Laboratory (LMSAL), and University of Colorado Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) will process, analyze, distribute, and archive the science data.

	abstract = {Abstract The NST (New Solar Telescope), a 1.6 m clear aperture, off-axis telescope, is in its commissioning phase at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). It will be the most capable, largest aperture solar telescope in the US until the 4 m ATST (Advanced Technology Solar Telescope) comes on-line late in the next decade. The NST will be outfitted with state-of-the-art scientific instruments at the Nasmyth focus on the telescope floor and in the Coudé Lab beneath the telescope. At the Nasmyth focus, several filtergraphs already in routine operation have offered high spatial resolution photometry in TiO 706 nm, Hα 656 nm, G-band 430 nm and the near infrared (NIR), with the aid of a correlation tracker and image reconstruction system. Also, a Cryogenic Infrared Spectrograph (CYRA) is being developed to supply high signal-to-noise-ratio spectrometry and polarimetry spanning 1.0 to 5.0 μm. The Coudé Lab instrumentation will include Adaptive Optics (AO), InfraRed Imaging Magnetograph (IRIM), Visible Imaging Magnetograph (VIM), and Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph (FISS). A 308 sub-aperture (349-actuator deformable mirror) AO system will enable nearly diffraction limited observations over the NST's principal operating wavelengths from 0.4 μm through 1.7 μm. IRIM and VIM are Fabry-Pérot based narrow-band tunable filters, which provide high resolution two-dimensional spectroscopic and polarimetric imaging in the NIR and visible respectively. FISS is a collaboration between BBSO and Seoul National University focussing on chromosphere dynamics. This paper reports the up-to-date progress on these instruments including an overview of each instrument and details of the current state of design, integration, calibration and setup/testing on the NST},

	abstract = {We have studied 8 yr of active region observations from the United States Air Force/Mount Wilson data set, supplied by the NOAA World Data Center, to confirm the relation between δ spots and large flares. We found that after correcting some errors we were able to describe relationships among active region size, peak flare soft X-ray (SXR) flux (measured by GOES 1-8 Å flux), and magnetic classification. We found the Solar Optical Observing Network magnetic classification to be reasonably accurate but its area measures to be inaccurate for many of the regions. This is due partly to transcription errors and partly to wrong correction for limb foreshortening. Errors could, however, be repaired by intercomparison of multiple observations. We confirm Künzel's original idea that regions classified βγδ produce many more large flares than other regions of comparable size. Almost all substantial flares occurred in regions classified βγδ by the Air Force sites. Each region larger than 1000 μh and classified βγδ had nearly 40\% probability of producing flares classified X1 or greater. Yet only a half-dozen of those, showing the "island delta" configuration, produced great activity. There is a general trend for large regions to produce large flares, but it is less significant than the dependence on magnetic class.},

	abstract = {The twin STEREO spacecraft were launched on October 26, 2006, at 00:52 UT from Kennedy Space Center aboard a Delta 7925 launch vehicle. After a series of highly eccentric Earth orbits with apogees beyond the moon, each spacecraft used close flybys of the moon to escape into orbits about the Sun near 1 AU. Once in heliospheric orbit, one spacecraft trails Earth while the other leads. As viewed from the Sun, the two spacecraft separate at approximately 44 to 45 degrees per year. The purposes of the STEREO Mission are to understand the causes and mechanisms of coronal mass ejection (CME) initiation and to follow the propagation of CMEs through the inner heliosphere to Earth. Researchers will use STEREO measurements to study the mechanisms and sites of energetic particle acceleration and to develop three-dimensional (3-D) time-dependent models of the magnetic topology, temperature, density and velocity of the solar wind between the Sun and Earth. To accomplish these goals, each STEREO spacecraft is equipped with an almost identical set of optical, radio and in situ particles and fields instruments provided by U.S. and European investigators. The SECCHI suite of instruments includes two white light coronagraphs, an extreme ultraviolet imager and two heliospheric white light imagers which track CMEs out to 1 AU. The IMPACT suite of instruments measures in situ solar wind electrons, energetic electrons, protons and heavier ions. IMPACT also includes a magnetometer to measure the in situ magnetic field strength and direction. The PLASTIC instrument measures the composition of heavy ions in the ambient plasma as well as protons and alpha particles. The S/WAVES instrument uses radio waves to track the location of CME-driven shocks and the 3-D topology of open field lines along which flow particles produced by solar flares. Each of the four instrument packages produce a small real-time stream of selected data for purposes of predicting space weather events at Earth. NOAA forecasters at the Space Environment Center and others will use these data in their space weather forecasting and their resultant products will be widely used throughout the world. In addition to the four instrument teams, there is substantial participation by modeling and theory oriented teams. All STEREO data are freely available through individual Web sites at the four Principal Investigator institutions as well as at the STEREO Science Center located at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.},

	abstract = {Some types of solar flares are observed in X-shaped quadrupolar field configuration. To understand the magnetic energy storage in such a region, we studied non-potential field formation in an X-shaped quadrupolar field region formed in the active region NOAA 11967, which produced three X-shaped M-class flares on 2014 February 2. Nonlinear force-free field modeling was applied to a time series of vector magnetic field maps from the Solar Optical Telescope on board Hinode and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Our analysis of the temporal three-dimensional magnetic field evolution shows that the sufficient free energy had already been stored more than 10 hr before the occurrence of the first M-class flare and that the storage was observed in a localized region. In this localized region, quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) started to develop gradually from 9 hr before the first M-class flare. One of the flare ribbons that appeared in the first M-class flare was co-spatial with the location of the QSLs, suggesting that the formation of the QSLs is important in the process of energy release. These QSLs do not appear in the potential field calculation, indicating that they were created by the non-potential field. The formation of the QSLs was associated with the transverse photospheric motion of the pre-emerged flux and the emergence of a new flux. This observation indicates that the occurrence of the flares requires the formation of QSLs in the non-potential field in which free magnetic energy is stored in advance.},

The determination of their 3D structure using a single viewpoint, however posed a challenge because only their 2D projection on the sky plane is observed. The operation of the STEREO mission with its unique capability of imaging the inner heliosphere from two viewpoints has greatly improved this situation. It is therefore timely to review the pre-STEREO efforts in 3D CME reconstruction and compare them with the first STEREO results in this area. Our paper focuses on the techniques relevant to the CME morphology: forward modeling, polarimetric, spectroscopic, direct inversion. We also discuss the limitations and considerations involved in each technique.},

	abstract = {Strong solar flares and coronal mass ejections, here defined not only as the bursts of electromagnetic radiation but as the entire process in which magnetic energy is released through magnetic reconnection and plasma instability, emanate from active regions (ARs) in which high magnetic non-potentiality resides in a wide variety of forms. This review focuses on the formation and evolution of flare-productive ARs from both observational and theoretical points of view. Starting from a general introduction of the genesis of ARs and solar flares, we give an overview of the key observational features during the long-term evolution in the pre-flare state, the rapid changes in the magnetic field associated with the flare occurrence, and the physical mechanisms behind these phenomena. Our picture of flare-productive ARs is summarized as follows: subject to the turbulent convection, the rising magnetic flux in the interior deforms into a complex structure and gains high non-potentiality; as the flux appears on the surface, an AR with large free magnetic energy and helicity is built, which is represented by \$\$\delta \$\$δ-sunspots, sheared polarity inversion lines, magnetic flux ropes, etc; the flare occurs when sufficient magnetic energy has accumulated, and the drastic coronal evolution affects magnetic fields even in the photosphere. We show that the improvement of observational instruments and modeling capabilities has significantly advanced our understanding in the last decades. Finally, we discuss the outstanding issues and future perspective and further broaden our scope to the possible applications of our knowledge to space-weather forecasting, extreme events in history, and corresponding stellar activities.},

Most flare forecasting efforts described in the literature use either line-of-sight magnetograms or a relatively small number of ground-based vector magnetograms. This is the first time a large data set of vector magnetograms has been used to forecast solar flares. We build a catalog of flaring and non-flaring active regions sampled from a database of 2071 active regions, comprised of 1.5 million active region patches of vector magnetic field data, and characterize each active region by 25 parameters. We then train and test the machine-learning algorithm and we estimate its performances using forecast verification metrics with an emphasis on the true skill statistic (TSS). We obtain relatively high TSS scores and overall predictive abilities. We surmise that this is partly due to fine-tuning the SVM for this purpose and also to an advantageous set of features that can only be calculated from vector magnetic field data. We also apply a feature selection algorithm to determine which of our 25 features are useful for discriminating between flaring and non-flaring active regions and conclude that only a handful are needed for good predictive abilities.},
